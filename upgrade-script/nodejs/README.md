Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.

- Navigate to the official Node.js website (nodejs.org).
- Download the recommended LTS (Long Term Support) version installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen prompts.
- Accept the license agreement and choose the installation location (the default is usually fine).
- Ensure that the "Add to PATH" option is selected during installation, as this allows you to run Node.js commands directly from your terminal or command prompt.
- Complete the installation process.

## NodeJS Setup
- This command should display the installed Node.js version, confirming a successful installation.: `node -v`
- This command should display the installed npm version.: `npm -v`
(Optional) Initialize a Node.js Project:
- Create a new directory for your project.
- Navigate into that directory in your terminal.
- Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project: : `npm init`
- (Optional) Install Packages: Once your project is initialized, you can install additional packages using npm. For example, to install Express.js: `npm install express`

## NodeJS Run
- Run an exmple code: `node ./app.js`
```bash
Hello, Node.js!
```
- Run es client
    - npm init
    ```bash
    $ npm init
    This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
    It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

    See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
    and exactly what they do.

    Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
    save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

    Press ^C at any time to quit.
